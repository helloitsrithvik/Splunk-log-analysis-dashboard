📊 Splunk Log Analysis Dashboard

> ⚠️ Note: This project is not a standalone application or script. It is a practical showcase of my Splunk skills, using tutorial data to create dashboards, alerts, and insights. It is intended for demonstration, learning, and portfolio purposes.

This project demonstrates my ability to build SIEM dashboards using Splunk for real-world log analysis, anomaly detection, and revenue monitoring. The dashboards were built using Splunk’s tutorial dataset and enriched with product pricing from a custom lookup table (Prices.csv).

🧩 What I Built

📌 Two interactive dashboards (Product Trends + Revenue Monitoring)

🔍 10+ SPL queries using stats, eval, lookup, timechart, top, streamstats

💡 Token-driven filters for dynamic dashboard inputs

🧠 Alert logic for sales drops and suspicious login activity

📁 Use of lookups to join custom CSV data (Prices.csv)

📊 Visualizations: bar charts, timecharts, single values, tables
